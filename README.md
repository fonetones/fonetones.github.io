# fonetones.github.io
Github fonetones website.
The idea is, a community will form who owns the FON token and through FON, owns 48% of the fonetones brand (abstract asset) value. The website will teach music and the community
will decide what musicians to contract. Fonetones will do the contracting and produce the music and sell it for minimum profit.
